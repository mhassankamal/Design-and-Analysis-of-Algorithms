# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of two fundamental problems in computational geometry; the computation of convex hulls and the detection of line intersections. Utilizing Python and the tkinter library, two separate scripts were developed to visualize these geometric concepts. The first script demonstrates various algorithms for computing convex hulls, while the second focuses on detecting intersections between line segments. This report explores the design, implementation, and performance of these algorithms, offering insights into their efficiency and real-world applications.
