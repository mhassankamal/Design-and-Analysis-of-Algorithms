# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms {Convex Hull and Line Intersection}
## Abstract
-->This report presents a comprehensive analysis of two fundamental problems in computational geometry: the computation of convex hulls and the detection of line intersections. Utilizing Python and the tkinter library, two separate scripts were developed to visualize these geometric concepts. The first script demonstrates various algorithms for computing convex hulls, while the second focuses on detecting intersections between line segments. This report explores the design, implementation, and performance of these algorithms, offering insights into their efficiency and real-world applications.
## 1 Introduction
-->Computational geometry is vibrant field of computer science that focuses on the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geomerty. This field plays a crucial role in various applications, ranging from computer graphics and geographic information systems to robotics and computer-aided design. Two fundamental problems in computational geometry, and the focus of this report, are the computation of convex hulls and the detection of line intersections.
